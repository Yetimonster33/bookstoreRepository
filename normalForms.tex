To simplify the dependancies:\\\\
bookstore\_attributes = owner\_fName, owner\_lName, contact\_email, url, password\\
book\_attributes = title, price, pub\_date genre, author, description, page\_count\\
publisher\_attributes =  account\_num, routing\_num, account\_size, email\\
user\_attributes = fName, lName, password\\
order\_attributes = curr\_locations, eta, order\_date\\
billing\_attributes = card\_num, name\_on\_card, expiry\_month, expiry\_year, CVC\\
address\_attributes = country, region, city, address, postal\_code\\\\
Functional dependancies:\\
Bookstore:\\ 
bookstore\_id $\rightarrow$  bookstore\_attributes, address\_id, username\\
username $\rightarrow$  bookstore\_attributes, address\_id, bookstore\_id\\
The left hand side of each functional dependancy is a primary key, therefore this relation is in 3NF\\\\
Book:\\
ISBN $\rightarrow$  book\_attributes, publisher\_id\\
The left hand side of the functional dependancy is a primary key, therefore this relation is in 3NF\\\\
Publisher:\\
publisher\_id $\rightarrow$  publisher\_attributes, address\_id, company\_name\\
company\_name $\rightarrow$  publisher\_attributes, address\_id, publisher\_id\\
The left hand side of the functional dependancy is a primary key, therefore this relation is in 3NF\\\\
User:\\
user\_id $\rightarrow$  user\_attributes, email, username\\
email $\rightarrow$  user\_attributes, user\_id, username\\
username $\rightarrow$  user\_attributes, email, user\_id\\
The left hand side of the functional dependancy is a primary key, therefore this relation is in 3NF\\\\
